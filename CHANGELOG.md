## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Profile surface refactored to services-tree shape (#69)**. The flat
  `core/src/profile.ts` was relocated to `core/src/services/profile/basic/index.ts`
  and the flat `cli/src/commands/profile.ts` to a `cli/src/commands/profile/`
  sub-tree mirroring the `cli/src/commands/auth/` precedent. This is a pure
  mechanical refactor — no behavior change — that gates the per-sub-domain
  implementation issues #70/#71/#72/#73-#76 (epic #68).
  - `@ttctl/core` exports change from flat (`getProfile`, `updateProfile`,
    `ProfileError`, `ProfileErrorCode`, `ProfileUpdate`, `UpdateProfileResult`)
    to namespaced. Consumers now write `import { profile } from "@ttctl/core"`
    and call `profile.basic.show(...)` / `profile.basic.set(...)`. Error class
    and types are reachable via the namespace (`profile.basic.ProfileError`,
    `profile.basic.ProfileErrorCode`, etc.). The `ProfileShowQuery` /
    `ProfileShowQueryVariables` codegen types remain at the top level.
  - Internal core function renames: `getProfile` → `show`, `updateProfile` → `set`
    (per the core-side verb economy `add` / `rm` / `set` / `show` / `list`).
  - CLI surface: `ttctl profile show` and `ttctl profile update --bio --headline`
    continue to work unchanged (preserved as direct aliases at the `profile`
    level — AC option A). Canonical forms `ttctl profile basic show` and
    `ttctl profile basic update --bio --headline` are now also available and
    will be the form documented going forward.
  - Placeholder modules added for the 10 follow-up sub-domains
    (`skills`, `industries`, `education`, `certifications`, `employment`,
    `portfolio`, `visas`, `resume`, `external`, `reviews`) in both core and
    CLI; these are empty `index.ts` stubs that establish the directory shape
    so #70/#71/#72/#73-#76 can land each sub-domain without further
    structural churn.
