/**
 * Acquire an advisory exclusive lock for `configPath`.
 *
 * Implementation: `proper-lockfile` creates `<configPath>.lock` as a
 * sibling DIRECTORY via atomic `mkdir(2)`. The `mkdir` syscall is atomic on
 * ext4, APFS, NTFS, and any other filesystem with POSIX-equivalent
 * semantics — `EEXIST` is the contention signal.
 *
 * Why sibling-lockfile and NOT self-lock: the atomic-rename pattern in
 * `performYamlMutation` swaps the inode at `<configPath>` mid-operation. A
 * `flock(fd)` on the original inode does NOT survive the rename and a
 * concurrent locker on the post-rename inode sees no contention. The
 * sibling pattern sidesteps this — the `.lock` directory's existence is the
 * lock signal, independent of the config file's inode.
 *
 * Cross-platform: works identically on Linux/macOS/Windows — `mkdir`-based
 * atomic creation is portable. No Windows no-op needed (in contrast to the
 * existing POSIX-mode logic in `loadConfigFile` and `performYamlMutation`,
 * which IS Windows-skipped because mode bits aren't meaningful).
 *
 * Contention: ≤1.0s wall-clock budget per `LOCK_RETRY_OPTIONS`. On timeout,
 * throws `ConfigError(LOCKED)` naming the path and suggesting retry — never
 * blocks indefinitely.
 *
 * `realpath: false` skips proper-lockfile's pre-flight `realpath()` check.
 * The caller has already resolved `configPath` to an absolute, symlink-free
 * path via `assertSafePath`, AND the config file may not exist yet (e.g.,
 * the lock is acquired BEFORE the stat baseline that throws ENOENT). With
 * `realpath: true` (the library default), a missing file would surface as
 * an opaque proper-lockfile error before our own ENOENT path runs.
