/**
 * Workspace dependency-confusion guard.
 *
 * Asserts that every `@ttctl/*` dependency declared by any workspace
 * package resolves to a workspace-internal package (pnpm's `link:`
 * resolution), never to a public registry. A `@ttctl/*` name resolving
 * to a registry version would mean either (a) someone published a
 * package under our scope without our involvement (dependency-confusion
 * attack), or (b) an internal `workspace:` ref got rewritten somewhere
 * along the build chain.
 *
 * The npm scope `@ttctl` is NOT reserved by the maintainer of this
 * project on npmjs.com — anyone could publish `@ttctl/anything` if they
 * registered the scope first. This guard is the defense.
 *
 * How it works:
 *   1. Run `pnpm ls --json --recursive --prod --depth=1` to enumerate
 *      every direct dependency declared by every workspace package.
 *   2. For each `@ttctl/*` dep, assert the resolved `version` field
 *      starts with `link:` — pnpm's marker for workspace-internal
 *      resolution. A version like `1.2.3` or `^1.2.3` means it resolved
 *      to a published registry version, which is the failure mode.
 *
 * Why `--prod`:
 *   The devDependencies block can legitimately contain registry-shaped
 *   versions for tooling. The user-install surface (the one supply-chain
 *   attacks target) is what's installed via `npm install -g ttctl`, which
 *   only pulls production deps. devDeps stay on the maintainer's
 *   machine and in CI.
 *
 * Why `--depth=1`:
 *   depth=0 lists only the workspace packages themselves with no
 *   dependency fields. depth=1 includes their direct deps. depth>1 would
 *   also include transitive deps, which we don't need — the only
 *   `@ttctl/*` names we care about are the ones WE declare.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — every `@ttctl/*` dep resolves to a workspace-internal package
 *   1 — one or more `@ttctl/*` deps resolve to a non-workspace version
 *
 * Wired into the root `lint` script (`package.json`) and runs on every
 * PR / push via `ci.yml`.
